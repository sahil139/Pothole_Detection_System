# Pothole_Detection_System

Pothole Detection System developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach.

Dataset Used: Custom grayscale images of potholes and plain roads.

Trained a CNN model with multiple variants:

16-layer architecture with varying kernel sizes and pooling strategies.
Preprocessed the images using OpenCV and resized them to uniform dimensions.
Implemented data augmentation and normalization techniques for robust training.
Achieved high accuracy in detecting potholes, validating the model on a separate dataset.

üìù Currently exploring further improvements in the model's performance by optimizing the convolutional layers and fine-tuning the hyperparameters.
